# EXP.4-MEASUREMENT-OF-INDUCTANCE-UISING-MAXWELLS-BRIDGE-
## AIM:

Measurement of unknown inductance using a Maxwell’s Bridge

## PROCEDURE:

STEP 1 : Make Connections as per the instructions given below:

M1 of MCB - P1 of Power & M2 of MCB - P2 of Power
OS1 of Oscillator - OS3 of Oscillator & OS2 of Oscillator - OS4 of Oscillator
S1 of Speaker - B of Circuit Diagram
S2 of Speaker - D of Circuit Diagram
COM - C of Circuit Diagram
L - D of Circuit Diagram
NOTE : If Wire is wrongly connected, Click on node number to detach the wire.

STEP 2 : Click on   CHECK  button for checking the connections.

STEP 3 : Click on the mcboff MCB to Turn ON mcbon the supply.

STEP 4 : Set Oscillator to maximum from dropdown.

STEP 5 : Select the values from various dropdown to get minimum sound from speaker.

STEP 6 : Click on   ADD  button to add the readings to the Observation Table.

NOTE: If combination is wrong then select another combination & the Balanced Condition Button becomes active after the wrong combination alert by clicking on the ADD button.

STEP 7 : Click on   PRINT  button to print the webpage.

STEP 8 : Click on   RESET  button to reset the webpage.

## OUTPUT: 

<img width="826" height="403" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa3ea1d5-3230-4b7e-bc73-4ec2e28c65bd" />

## FORMULA: 
    Find L (Unknown inductance)

    L = (L1*R3)/R1

    Where, R1=P+Q+X

    R2 = minimum we will neglect it

  ## Result:
  
  Measurement of unknown inductance using a Maxwell’s Bridge completed
